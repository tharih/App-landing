              <span>Information Collected Upon Registration:</span> When you create or
              reconfigure a Tackgram account, you provide some personal
              information, such as your name, username, password, and email
              address. Some of this information, for example, your name and
              username, is listed publicly on our Services, including on your
              profile page and in search results. Services, such as search,
              public user profiles, do not require registration.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>Additional Information:</span> You may provide us with additional
              information to make public, such as a short biography "Bio", your
              location, or a picture. We may use your contact information to
              send you information about our Services or to market to you. You
              may unsubscribe from these messages by following the instructions
              contained within the messages or the instructions on our
              applications. If you email us, we may keep your message, email
              address and contact information to respond to your request.
              Providing the additional information described in this section is
              entirely optional.

            <p>
              <span>Posts, Following, and other Public Information:</span> Our Services are
              primarily designed to help you share information with the world.
              Most of the information you provide to us is information you are
              asking us to make public. This includes not only the messages you
              Post, and the metadata provided with Posts, such as when you
              Posted, also the people you follow, the Posts you mark as
              favorites or Repost or Events and many other bits of information.
              Our default is almost always to make the information you provide
              public, but we generally give you settings to make the information
              more private if you want. Your public information is broadly and
              instantly disseminated. For example, your public Posts are
              searchable by many search engines and are immediately delivered to
              a wide range of users and services. You should be careful about
              all information that will be made public by Tackgram, not just
              your Posts.

              <span>Log Data:</span> Our server’s automatically records information (“Log
              Data”) created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include
              information such as your IP address, your mobile carrier, device
              and application IDs, and search terms. Other actions, such as
              interactions with our applications, may also be included in Log
              Data. If we haven’t already deleted the Log Data earlier, we will
              either delete it or remove any common account identifiers, such as
              your username, full IP address, or email address, after 6 months.

            <p>
              <span>Links:</span> Tackgram may keep track of how you interact with links in
              Posts across our Services and clients by redirecting clicks or
              through other means. We do this to help improve our Services and
              to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many
              times a particular link was clicked on.

            <p>
              <span>Security of data:</span> The security of your personal data is important
              to us; we guarantee its absolute security. This is the main reason
              that the Tackgram platform was created for “high user privacy.”
              Also, we will never sell your information to third parties under
              any circumstance. Your privacy is very important to us, more than
              anything.

              <span>Third Party Services:</span> Tackgram uses a variety of services hosted

              Analytics.

            <h4>End-to-end encryption in Direct Messages</h4>
            <p>
              <span>Privacy and security:</span> Privacy and security are in our DNA, which
              is why we built end-to-end encryption into our Direct Messages.
              When end-to-end encrypted, your messages, photos, videos, voice
              messages and documents are secured from falling into the wrong
              hands.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Personal Messaging:</span> Tackgram's end-to-end encryption is used when
              you chat with another person on the Tackgram app. End-to-end
              encryption ensures only you and the person you're communicating
              with can read or listen to what is sent and nobody in between, not
              even Tackgram. This is because, with end-to-end encryption, your
              messages are secured with a lock. Only you and the recipient have
              the special key needed to unlock then read messages. All of this
              happens automatically: no need to turn on any special settings to
              secure your messages.
            </p>
            <p>
             <span>What's the "Verify Security Code" screen in the conversation info
              screen?</span> 
            </p>

            <p>
              End-to-end encrypted chats have their own security code used to
              verify that the messages you send to that chat are end-to-end
              encrypted.
            </p>

            <p>
              {" "}
              <span>Note:</span> The verification process is optional for end-to-end
              encrypted chats, and only used to confirm that the messages you
              send are end-to-end encrypted.
            </p>

            <p>
              This code can be found in the conversation info screen, both as a
              QR code and a 60-digit number. These codes are unique to each chat
              and can be compared between individuals to verify that messages
              sent are indeed end-to-end encrypted. Security codes are just
              visible versions of the special key shared in messages (do not
              worry, it's not the actual key itself, that's always kept secret.)
            </p>

            <p>
              Tackgram has no ability to see the content of messages or listen
              to voice messages that is end-to-end encrypted. That’s because the
              encryption and decryption of messages sent and received on
              Tackgram occur entirely on your device. Before a message ever
              leaves your device, it is secured with a cryptographic lock and
              only the recipient has the keys. In addition, the keys change with
              every single message that's sent. While all of this happens behind
              the scenes, you can confirm your conversations are protected by
              checking the security verification code on your device.
