            <h2>Tackgram Rules</h2>
            <p>
              Tackgram's purpose is to serve the public conversation. Violence,
              harassment and other similar types of behavior discourage people
              from expressing themselves, and ultimately diminish the value of
              global public conversation. Our rules are to ensure all people can
              participate in the public conversation freely and safely.
