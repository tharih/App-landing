            <h4>What's Tackgram</h4>
            <p>
              Tackgram is a social media entertainment platform to tell your
              jokes, find fun events, connect with people and express your
              thoughts openly with those who share your interests. In Tackgram,
              you can share any kind of posts. The posts will be displayed on
              your profile and other users who follow you will see a post in
              their own timeline. Likewise, you'll see posts from other users
              whom you choose to follow. Through this platform, users are
              empowered to post what's on their minds as they interact with the
              world. Interaction includes direct messages, sharing experiences
              with hashtags, media, reactions, and beyond. Wherever there is
              popular humor or entertainment we strive for it to occur on
              Tackgram first.
