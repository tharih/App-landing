              The verified badge on Tackgram lets people know that an account is
              the authentic presence of the public figure, celebrity or global
              brand it represents. The badge appears next to the name on an
              account’s profile and next to the account name in search results.

              Accounts that don’t have the badge next to their name but that
              display it somewhere else, for example in the profile photo,

              Verified badges must be applied by Tackgram, and accounts that use
              a badge as a part of profile photos, background photos, or in any
              other way that implies verified status, are subject to permanent
              account suspension.

            <h4>What types of accounts get verified?</h4>
            <p>
              An account may be verified if it is determined to be an account of
              public interest. Typically, this includes accounts maintained by
              users in Entertainment, Comedians, Music, Sports, Technology,
              Travel, Art, Gaming, Acting, Fashion, Media, Business, Influential
              Individuals and other key interest areas.
            </p>

            <p>A verified badge does not imply an endorsement by Tackgram.</p>
<div className="about-sub-sub-topic">

            <p>
              Tip: Tackgram will never, ever ask you for your password. If you
              receive a verification request asking for your account
              information, it's false.

            <p>
              Not at this moment. Unfortunately, verification is not currently
              open to the general public. Our verification system will pick
              accounts automatically, depending on users’ activities on
              Tackgram.

            <h4>How do I know if I am verified? </h4>
            <p>
              Look for the verified badge on your Tackgram profile. All verified
              accounts have the badge next to their display name.

            <h4>Recommended security precaution.</h4>
            <p>
              Verified accounts may become targets for hacking or phishing
              campaigns. The following precautions are recommended for all
              users, but in particular users with verified accounts:

            <p>
            <span>●</span> If your
              account was recently verified, we recommend you reset your
              password and use a strong password for more security.
            </p>
            <p><span>●</span> Make sure
              the email address associated with your account is secure.</p>

            <h4>Can I request to remove my verified badge?</h4>

            It’s not currently possible to request that Tackgram remove your verified badge.

            <h4>Loss of verified status.</h4>
            <p>
            Tackgram reserves the right to remove verification at any time without notice.











            </p>
            <p>Reasons for removal may reflect behaviors on and off Tackgram that include:</p>
            <p><span>●</span> Intentionally misleading people on Tackgram by changing one's display name or bio.</p>
<p><span>●</span> If an account changes their username (@handle).</p>
<p><span>●</span> If an account becomes inactive or incomplete.</p>
<p><span>●</span> If the owner of the account is no longer for which position, they were initially verified and do not otherwise meet our criteria for verification since leaving such position.</p>
<p><span>●</span> Promoting hate and/or violence against, or directly attacking or threatening other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease. Supporting organizations or individuals that promote the above.</p>

<p>Tip: Changing your username will result in losing your badge.</p>
</div>
<p>Tackgram may remove the verified badge and verify the status of a Tackgram account at any time. A verified account may also lose its verified status if changes to the profile settings modify the account’s original purpose.</p>
          <p>Previously verified accounts may not be eligible to have badges restored.</p>
